        <h2>Y/N: Let me tell you about my life. My husband, Jeon Jungkook and I had an arrange marriage about a year ago. However, he is a very cold and distant person - despite all of that,
            I still love him very much - even when I don't recieve anything in return or a response. Thus leaving me all alone.</h2><p></p><h2> My Kookie doesn't like hugs or kisses let alone talking with me. 
        I am the complete opposite, I give him a short peck on his cheek and quick side hugs. These days though, I've been disappointed by his cold attitude. It is currently night I was waiting for him to come home from work. As soon as he was in-sight,
        I ran to him and give him a cheeky smile while hugging him and kissed him. I asked him 'How was your day?'He respond with:
        <p></p><h2>JK: Hmmm...Okay. Frowning, I sent him upstairs to freshen up while I prepared dinner. I asked him:<p></p>Y/N:'I made your favorite, By the way - you haven't had dinner yet right?
            <p></p>JK: I had it at my office.<p></p>Y/N: 'Again? You should've told me! I was waiting for you...I even made your favorite dishes!Now who's going to eat them?'(pout)<p></p>JK:'Who told you to wait for me huh? Did I ask you to make these dishes? No right? Then why did you make them?
            Just throw them away...and STOP YOUR DRAMA! You annoy me every single time I see you!<p></p>With take he stormed up to our shared room and slammed the door. I was crying, Y/N: 'Why does he always act the same way towards me? He really hate me doesn't he?...OKAY THEN I WON'T ANYMORE!'
