                <h2>Suddendly Jimin's phone rang, picking up the call and talking for awhile, he pulled his friend up and sent him home by taxi. Taehyung being drunk, <p></p>V: 'Wa..i..t' the driver stopped and looked at him confusingly, "That's not
                my house address!! See sir.. (hiccup) my friend doesn't know that I'm already married. He told you my old house address. It's XXXXXXXXX!' Arriving at the address, Taehyung didn't wake up, making the driver help him  walk to the door and ring the doorbell.</h2>
            <h2>Opening the door, I yawned wakeing up from the couch, watching a movie. My eyes widened seeing Taehyung and an unknown man.<p></p><h2>Driver: 'Ma'am your husband got drunk and I'm here to drop him.'<p></p>Y/N: 'WTH? ... husban..'<p></p>Driver: 'Please take him, he's quite heavy.' He cut me off and handed me Taehyung with that, he left.
            Driver: 'His friend already paid the fair...so you don't have to give me money...goodnight.'</h2><p></p>
            <h2>Having no other choice, I take him inside and up to my room, but with difficulty since he was bigger and heavier for me. Putting him on the bed - more like throwing him onto the bed - I was about to leave; however Tae grabbed me and hugged me very tight.<p></p>Y/N: 'Ya! Get your hands off me you perverted jerk!'
                <h2>However, Tae did not listen but instead, tighten his graspped and hugged me tighter. "Maybe he though I was his pillows?" Slowly, Tae opened his eyes, his face turning from a tame bear, to boxy-smiling pervert. „Ä†<p></p>
                    
                    <h2>V: 'Oh my beautiful wife-ie...' As he spoke, he brought his face closer to mine - making me turn my head in the opposite direction.</h2>
            <h2>Y/N: 'You jerk!! Your breath stinks!!' I yelled making him pout! "Oh that lip (internally screaming)"<p></p><h2>V: 'My breath stinks?? So what?? givemeee a kiss...you' He said pouting his lips so I could give him a kiss.<p></p>Y/N: 'Wh-at? No! You're drunk...let me goo!' V: 'Why? kiss mee...' He started sulking, making me want to squish his cheeks. V: 'You don't want to kiss me? Then I'll...'
            With that, he kissed me on my FREAK'IN LIPS!! AHH! Dang you Kim Taehyung! My reflects kicked in...so I punched him in his gut/stomache making him groan loudly. </h2>
