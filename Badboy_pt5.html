            <h2>Taehyung's eyes began to tear up, he can't help but to be emotional. He is beyond thankful to have you in his corner...and that he can call you HIS!<p></p>
            <h2>He can't help but to sob, since he finally found the love and care he has been craving for.<p></p><h2>Sometimes, it's not only about friends; but lover(s) too. 
            <h2>Of course his parents love him dearly; however, they are always busy...that they can't give their attention and care towards him.</h2>
                <h2>Seeing you show so much care and love...just makes him more emotional. Seeing him crying, I grew more worried, quickly hugging him.
             <h2>I began rubbing/patting his back slowly as I whispered softly into his ear:<h2>Y/N: 'Shhh. its okay... I'm not mad at you okay...I'm just worried.' I said as he nodded his head while sniffling.<p></p>
                <h2>Y/N: 'Now, tell me where you got hurt...hmm? So we can treat it.' I slowly parted wiping his tears.<p></p><h2>V: 'Here...and here...and all of my face!' He said while pointing to the spots. He was looking
                    <h2>so cute that I had to squish his cheeks and he winced.</h2><p></p><h2>V: 'Ahhh my face...it hurts!'<p></p>Y/N: I am sorry...I'm sorry, baby.'</h2>
                    <h2>When I called him by his nickname, he couldn't help but to blush. However, I did not noticed since I was too busy rubbing his bruised cheeks.</h2>
                <p></p><h2>Seeing his blushing face, I smiled widely...pecking him before I said: <p></p>Y/N: 'I LOVE YOU 3000 Taehyung.'<p></p>V: 'ONLY 3000?!'</h2>
                <p>THE END</p>
