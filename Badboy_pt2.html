            <h2>Actually I cannot read all the signs because there were too many! Who even does this kind of things anymore? Strangely, all the students were looking at me...it made me really nervous, but I didn't show it.</h2>
            <h2>Continuing to walk to the room, I spot 'the badboy' standing there with a rose in his hands making me sigh. 'Is he here to make trouble again? I tried to walk pass him but he grabbed my arm and pulled me back harshly.</h2><p></p>
            <h2>Y/N:'Ugh what do you want?<p></p><h2>V: "Why are you in a rush baby?....I'm here to tell you something this important...in fact it's gonna change our FUTURE!<h2>Y/N:'YA! What's more important than water?' He gulpped.</h2>
            <h2>Y/N:'What?' V: 'I know I'm rushing but...will you be my girlfriend?' WTH was that!?!<p></p><h2>Y/N: This IS NOT THE TIME TO JOKE!</h2><p></p><h2>V: 'What do you think I'm joking? LOOK Around! I did all this for you!'</h2>
            <h2>Y/N:'Well I didn't tell you to do that...did I?'....'I have a test...see you never!'</h2><p></p><h2>V: 'What are all of you looking at?' Everyone scattered fearing him.<p></p>[After School...At a club]<p></p>Taehyung drinking at a bar with his soulmate „Ä† „Ä† </h2>
            <h2>V:'Jiminnie!!! what do I do to get her?!' He asked frustratingly, Continuing to drink his shot.<p></p><h2>Jimin: Assh.. tsk. 'Stop drinking, you're already drunk! We'll figure it out when you're sober!' Worried for his friend...who won't stop drinking.</h2>
            <h2> V:'No I want my Y/Nniee!!'<p></p><h2>Jimin: 'Alright but first stop you stubborm Alien!<p></p>V: 'No! I want y/nnnie!!!my baby!<p></p>Jimin: 'What if Y/N heard you drinking? She won't like it!' He mentioned my name, not knowing what to do to make him stop drinking.</h2>
            <h2>V: 'Really? Y/N doesn't like bad boyss? no.no.no.! ssee, Jimin it wasn't me who drinks it! It was the drinking who made me drink!' Putting the blame on something that isn't even alive!</h2><p></p>
