            <p></p><h2>You were working at your part-time job as a barista. Feeling tired since you came to work after school and from another job. However, you were not poor - you just like being independent and having pocket money.
            Hearing the door close, you headed back to the register. When looking at the clock, you see that's the end of your shift but decided to serve one last person.
            Feeling the familiar presense, you knew who this customer was. Grabbing a pen and a notepad you began writing down the order after you irritatingly asked the customer: 'What do you want?'</h2><p></p>
            <h2>The customer responded: 'a service  with a smile.' Hearing the deep voice, you look up to see...the school badboy, Kim Taehyung, licking his lips and staring right through your soul.</h2><p></p>
            <h2>I frustratingly commented: 'I repeat...WHAT.DO.YOU.WANT' Tired of the day's work, I wasn't exactly in the mood to deal with him or his flirting. Not personally being a cold person, 
                however, I was too tired and acted arrogantly-but not intentionally.</h2><p></p>
            <h2>V: 'A-ah hot chocolate and black coffee. He stuttered a bit shocking me since he has never done it in the past. What do you expect? he's the badboy...but now guess what? That's my of your concern.</h2><p></p>
            <h2>V: 'You're Lee [y/n] right? I know you are, I usually see you with your boy-best friend! But I'm more hot and handsome...</h2>
            <h2>'Your order Mr. Black...Just like your heart. I took off my apron and left, leaving a smiling Taehyung inside.<p></p>V: 'I still like you...you'll soon be mine Kim [Y/N]<p></p>Next Day<p></p>Walking through the hallways, I saw all students holding a red rose and banners with: "Be mine ♡", "I ♡ U", "You are Beautiful", "Would you be my Winter Bear" and so on and so forth</h2>
