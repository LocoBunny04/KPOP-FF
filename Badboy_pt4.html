            <!--<h2>V: 'Oh my beautiful wife-ie...' As he spoke, he brought his face closer to mine - making me turn my head in the opposite direction.</h2>-->
            <h2>Before sleep overtook him<p></p>
            <h2>Tae mumbled 'Damn...I kissed Y/N in my dream!...
            This is the best dream ever! I swear if this was real, she would've punch me hehe...' With that, he fell asleep with his eyes open, frightening me a little bit.</h2>
            <h2>However, since I was too tired, I did not noticed, I ended up falling asleep.<p></p><h2>[Next Morning]<p></p><h2>I suddendly woke up hearing a scream. I sat up and rubbed my eyes, I widened my eyes...I slept with Taehyung...on.the.same.frickin.bed!<p></p>V: 'The hell? Y/N why does my stomache hurt so bad?' He said while crying, making me panic.
            <p></p>Y/N: 'Hey don't cry okay?...I'll get you some medicine! I ran out in search of pain realivers and a cup of water. Meanwhile, Taehyung was wondering if its hurting badly or not but seeing you coming back with a Worried look. This made him emotional, as he started to sniffle... Making me you more guilty, since you were the one who
        punched him...but dare not to say it was you.<p></p>Y/N: 'Here, take this medicine...and you'll feel better.' He did as I told him and laid back down on the bed.<p></p>
        <h2>V: 'But I want cu. (hiccup) ddles!' Y/N: 'What..? no--' V: 'But my stomache hurts!' Y/N: 'Fine!'</h2>
            <h2>Having no other choice, we both cuddled making him the happiest in this ff. I don't know why, but I don't feel uncomfortable with him...in fact...I felt safe in his arms.<p></p><p>A few months later</p><h2>A few months had pass and Tae had proposed to me; however, I was not sure about my feelings yet...so I kept rejecting him, but the 10th time...I finally accepted his proposal.</h2>
                <h2>Now, we're both officially dating!! Since then, his favorite number is '10' is what he said.</h2><p></p><h2>Now I just reached the school, there were about 30 minutes left. However, I saw a crowd in the hallways, curiousity got the best of me; I head towards the direction of the crowd. Two boys were fighting, one of the participant looked familiar, so I asked the student nearest to me.</h2>
            <h2>Y/N: 'What happened here?' Student1:'Taehyung and Max are fighting!' Hearing Tae's name, my eyes widened, I quickly pushed the other students and shouted:<p></p>'KIM TAEHYUNG! Didn't I tell you to stop fighting!?'<p></p>Recongnizing my voice, Tae released his hold on Max, before standing and meeting my burning glare.<p></p><h2>V: 'Y/N...'<p></p>
                <h2>he mumbled just loud enough for me to hear and I sighed deeply.<p></p>Y/N: 'Why the heck are you fighting with him! Huh?'<p></p>V: 'He said he likes you...so I...'<p></p>Y/N: 'That's nonsense!...So you were the one who started the fight?!Look at your face! You could've gotten hurt!' I couldn't help but to scold him, as I was beyond worried. Like who wouldn't? When your love one gets hurt,
                you just can't help but to get worry since you care for that person dearly.<h2></h2>
